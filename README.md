# NewsApp-SOLID-Swift
SOLID in Swift â€“ Simplified with Real Code

A simple SwiftUI project that demonstrates how to structure code following the **SOLID principles** using a real-world example: fetching and displaying news from the [NewsData API](https://newsdata.io/).

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This app:
- Fetches the latest news from a public API.
- Displays them in a clean SwiftUI list with thumbnails.
- Follows **SOLID** design principles for clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

---

## ðŸ§© SOLID Principles Recap

- **S â€“ Single Responsibility**  
  Each file/class/struct does exactly one job.

- **O â€“ Open/Closed**  
  Add new features without modifying existing code.

- **L â€“ Liskov Substitution**  
  You can replace a class with its subclass without breaking anything.

- **I â€“ Interface Segregation**  
  No class is forced to implement methods it doesnâ€™t need.

- **D â€“ Dependency Inversion**  
  High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
